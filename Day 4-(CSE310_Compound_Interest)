// Rahul has taken the loan from bank. Write the java code to calculate the compoud interest which is paybale to bank after the years.
// if the principal amount is less than 0 than
// return 0.0 if the rate of interest is less than 0 than
// return 0.0 if the Time period is less than 0 than
// return 0.0 if number of times interest compounded is less than 0 than
// return 0.0

// Input Format
// Line 1: Enter the Principal: 15000 Line 2: Enter the Rate of interest: 8.77 
// Line 3: Enter the Time period : 8 Enter number of times interest is compounded: 7

// Constraints
// principal amount, interest rate, year and number of times interest > 0

// Output Format
// Line 1: Compound Interest: 1646890.6976373557

// code starts from here.
