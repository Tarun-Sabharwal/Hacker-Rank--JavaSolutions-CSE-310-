/*  Dr. Max has conducted the academic task in his class with 5 Multiple Choice Questions each having 4 options A/B/C/D.
He wanted to write a program which can evaluate the test papers of all the N students such that each correct answer is awarded
1 mark and for incorrect answer penalty is 0.25 marks.
The program must read the number of students N and the the answers of all the N students in the form of a String.
If any question is not attempted by any student, then X should be given as input corresponding to that question e.g. ABAXD
It is expected that the marks of all the N students are displayed separated by SPACE.

Input Format
First Line of the input reads the String of CORRECT ANSWERS
Second Line of the input reads the number of students N
Next N lines read the answer Strings of the N students respectively.

Constraints
N > 0
Input characters can be either in Upper Case or Lower Case

Output Format
Print the marks of all the N students separated by SPACE */
