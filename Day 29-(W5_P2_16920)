/* Mrs. Jhunjhunwala has taught Programming in Java to the second-year students in ICE college and conducted 3 academic tasks for all the (N) students.
Marks are store in a 2-D array but now Mrs. Jhunjhunwala is willing to implement a java program which can accept the 2-D array of marks and return
the average marks of Best 2 Academic Tasks of each student. Help her to implement a method public double[] average_marks(double [][] marks)

Input Format
First line reads the number of students N
Next N lines read the marks of each student seperated by space

Constraints
n>0

Output Format
Prints the Avaerage marks of best 2 Academic tasks of N students separated by space */
