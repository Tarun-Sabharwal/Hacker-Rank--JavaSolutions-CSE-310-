/*  Chacha Chaudhary has asked Sheena to find out the Nth occurence of any Word in the Paragraph.
Sheena finds it a tedious task to find Nth occurence so she wants you to write a small java program which can solve her problem and 
she will give you a gift for helping her. Let us write a code.

Input Format
First line reads the paragraph contents
Second line reads the word to be found and N separated by Space

Constraints
N>0

Output Format
Prints the starting index of the Nth occurence of the word in the paragraph
Prints Not Present if not occuring even a single time and prints the last occurence if occuring less than N times. */

// code starts from here

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution. */
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String text = sc.nextLine();
        String pattern = sc.next();
        int index = sc.nextInt();
        int start = 0;
        for( int i = 0 ; i  < index ;i++){
            if(text.indexOf(pattern,start) == -1)break;
            start = text.indexOf(pattern,start) + 1;
        }
        switch(start){
            case 0:
                System.out.println("Not Present");
                break; 
            default:
                System.out.println(start -1 );    
        }
