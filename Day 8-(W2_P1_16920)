// Prof. Decosta has designed multiple sets of the question paper of
// CSE310: Programming in Java subject. He has assigned a separate character code (A-Z) to
// each set of question paper but mentioned the paper codes using binary numbers. 
// He needs a program which can accept the binary paper code and convert it in to character 
// code so that he can easily identify the paper code during evaluation. If the paper code entered is not 
// having 8 bits (0 or 1) or does not correspond to A-Z then INVALID PAPER CODE must be printed.

// Input Format
// First line of input is a Binary Number representing the Paper Code

// Constraints
// Paper code is a 8 bit binary code

// Output Format
// Print the Paper Code (Character) and INVALID PAPER CODE if the input is not correct.

// code starts from here
