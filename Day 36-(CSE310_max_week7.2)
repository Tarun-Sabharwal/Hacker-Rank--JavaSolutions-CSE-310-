/*  Write a program to take a String input from the user having length greater than 3. Ask the user to give character input and find how many no. of times
that character is present in the string. If length of the string entered by the user is <=3, then display message "Invalid".

Input Format
Program should take 2 inputs in following sequence: 1) String input 2) Character input

Constraints
If length of the string entered by the user is <=3, then display message "Invalid" and the second input (i.e. character input) should not be taken from user.

Output Format
Display how many no. of times a particular character (specified by user at run-time) is present in the string.  */
