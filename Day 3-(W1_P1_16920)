// During the code-based test of Java, Peter has been assigned a task to implement a class which reads the Account Number(Long), Account Holder Name(String), Gender (M/F) (Character) and Amount (Integer) to be withdrawn at runtime.
// Given that the Current Account Balance is 20000, it is expected to perform the withdrawl if amount to be withdrawn is less than or equal to 20000 and message to be displayed is:
// Hi Mr./Ms. XXX! Your Account Balance after withdrawal is YYYYY.
// If the amount to be withdrawn is greater than the Current Account Balance, then the message displayed is:
// Hi Mr./Ms. XXX! Insufficient Funds! You cannot withdraw AAAAA.

// Input Format
// First line reads Account Number
// Second line reads Account Holder Name
// Third line reads Gender
// Fourth line reads Amount to be withdrawn

// Constraints
// Account Number is a 10 digit number

// Output Format
// **Hi Mr./Ms. XXX!
// Your Account Balance after withdrawal is YYYYY.**

// code starts from here.
