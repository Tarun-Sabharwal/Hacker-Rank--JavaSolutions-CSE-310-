// Alice is asked to implement a Java program in which 3 integers X, Y are taken as input and all the numbers 
// between X and Y (excluding X and Y) must be added and the sum is displayed as output. If there is no number in
// between, in cases like Y is greater than X or both are equal, etc., NO OUTPUT should be displayed.

// Input Format
// two positive int numbers

// Constraints
// no negative or floating point numbers

// Output Format
// a int type positive number

// code starts from here

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
